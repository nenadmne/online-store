### About Website

The website you are about to explore is a dynamic online store that caters to the needs of three distinct user states: Admin, User, and Non-Registered User. Each state offers a unique set of functionalities and access rights tailored to their role. Let's delve into what each user state can do:

**Admin:**
As an admin, you wield significant control and responsibilities. Here's what you can do:

Product Management: You have the authority to add, edit, and remove products from the store. This means you can keep the product catalog up to date with the latest offerings.

User Management: You have the power to manage users on the platform. This includes the ability to add or delete user accounts, ensuring the integrity of the user database.

Review Management: You can moderate and manage reviews and ratings submitted by users. This ensures that the platform maintains a high level of quality and trustworthiness.

**User:**
Registered users have their own set of features and functions to enhance their online shopping experience:

Account Management: Users can edit their own profiles, including personal information and preferences. They can also delete their accounts if they choose to do so.

Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their shopping carts, making it easy to keep track of products they wish to purchase.

Order Submission: Users can submit orders for their selected items. These orders are sent to the admin for review and processing. Admin can choose to accept or decline the orders.

Product Reviews: Users can share their thoughts and experiences by posting reviews and ratings for specific items in the store. This feedback helps other users make informed decisions.

**Non-registered user:**
For those who haven't registered on the website, the experience is more limited:

Product Browsing: Non-registered users can view the product list and access detailed information about each product.

Product Details: They can dive into the specifics of individual products, such as descriptions, images, and pricing. However, they won't have the ability to leave reviews or add items to a shopping cart.
